                        distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas
                        and dense forests, and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be
                        found in groups as large as
                        100 individuals, but usually live in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is hunted for its
                        meat and hide
                        and also for grease from its thick fatty skin.[3] It is not considered a threatened species.

                    <p>Its common name is derived from Tupi ka'apiûara, a complex agglutination of kaá (leaf) + píi

                        "grass-eater".[4]<br><br> The scientific name, both hydrochoerus and hydrochaeris, comes from
                        Greek ὕδωρ (hydor "water") and χοῖρος
                        (choiros "pig, hog").[5][6]</p>

                    <p>The capybara and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_capybara">lesser cabybara</a> both belong to the subfamily Hydrochoerinae
                        along with the rock cavies. The living capybaras and their extinct relatives were previously 
                        classified in their own family Hydrochoeridae.[7] Since 2002, molecular phylogenetic studies have 
                        recognized a close relationship between Hydrochoerus and Kerodon, the rock cavies,[8] supporting 
                        placement of both genera in a subfamily of Caviidae.[5]<br><br>
                        Paleontological classifications previously used Hydrochoeridae for all capybaras, while using
                        Hydrochoerinae for the living genus and its closest fossil relatives, such as Neochoerus,[9][10]
                        but more recently have adopted the classification of Hydrochoerinae within Caviidae.[11] The
                        taxonomy of fossil hydrochoerines is also in a state of flux. In recent years, the diversity of
                        fossil hydrochoerines has been substantially reduced.[9][10] This is largely due to the
                        recognition that capybara molar teeth show strong variation in shape over the life of an
                        individual.[9] In one instance, material once referred to four genera and seven species on the
                        basis of differences in molar shape is now thought to represent differently aged individuals of
                        a single species, Cardiatherium paranense.[9] Among fossil species, the name "capybara" can
                        refer to the many species of Hydrochoerinae that are more closely related to the modern
                        Hydrochoerus than to the "cardiomyine" rodents like Cardiomys.[11] The fossil genera
                        Cardiatherium, Phugatherium, Hydrochoeropsis, and Neochoerus are all capybaras under that
                        concept.[11]</p>

                        The capybara has a heavy, barrel-shaped body and short head, with reddish-brown fur on the upper
                        part of its body that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands can be found in the
                        surface of the hairy portions of its skin, an unusual trait among rodents.[7] The animal lacks
                        down hair, and its guard hair differs little from over hair.[12]<br><br>Adult capybaras grow to
                        106 to 134 cm (3.48 to 4.40 ft) in length, stand 50 to 62 cm (20 to 24 in) tall at the withers,
                        and typically weigh 35 to 66 kg (77 to 146 lb), with an average in the Venezuelan llanos of 48.9
                        kg (108 lb).[13][14][15] Females are slightly heavier than males. The top recorded weights are
                        91 kg (201 lb) for a wild female from Brazil and 73.5 kg (162 lb) for a wild male from
                        Uruguay.[7][16] Also, an 81 kg individual was reported in São Paulo in 2001 or 2002.[17] The

                        longer than their forelegs; they have three toes on their rear feet and four toes on their front
                        feet.[18] Their muzzles are blunt, with nostrils, and the eyes and ears are near the top of

                    <p>Capybaras are semiaquatic mammals[15] found throughout all countries of South America except
                        Chile.[19] They live in densely forested areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers,
                        swamps, ponds, and marshes,[14] as well as flooded savannah and along rivers in the tropical
                        rainforest. They are superb swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes
                        at a time. Capybara have flourished in cattle ranches.[7] They roam in home ranges averaging 10
                        hectares (25 acres) in high-density populations.[7]<br><br>
                        Many escapees from captivity can also be found in similar watery habitats around the world.
                        Sightings are fairly common in Florida, although a breeding population has not yet been
                        confirmed.[20] In 2011, one specimen was spotted on the Central Coast of California.[21] These
                        escaped populations occur in areas where prehistoric capybaras inhabited; late Pleistocene
                        capybaras inhabited Florida[22] and Hydrochoerus hesperotiganites in California and Hydrochoerus
                        gaylordi in Grenada, and feral capybaras in North America may actually fill the ecological niche
                        of the Pleistocene species.[23]</p>

                    <p>Capybaras are herbivores, grazing mainly on grasses and aquatic plants,[14][24] as well as fruit
                        and tree bark.[15] They are very selective feeders[25] and feed on the leaves of one species and
                        disregard other species surrounding it. They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry
                        season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to
                        switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season.[26] Plants that capybaras eat during the
                        summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so they are not consumed at that time.[25]
                        The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth
                        rather than side-to-side.[27] Capybaras are autocoprophagous,[28] meaning they eat their own
                        feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms
                        their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They also
                        regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle.[28][29] As is the case
                        with other rodents, the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant
                        wear from eating grasses;[19] their cheek teeth also grow continuously.[27]</p><br>Like its
                    relative the guinea pig, the capybara does not have the capacity to synthesize vitamin C, and
                    capybaras not supplemented with vitamin C in captivity have been reported to develop gum disease as
                    a sign of scurvy.[30]<br><br>They can have a lifespan of 8–10 years,[31] but tend to live less than
                    four years in the wild due to predation from jaguars, pumas, ocelots, eagles, and caimans.[19] The
                    capybara is also the preferred prey of the green anaconda.[32]</p>
