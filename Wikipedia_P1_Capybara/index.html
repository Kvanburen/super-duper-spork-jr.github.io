            <p>The <b>capybara[a]</b> or <b>greater capybara <i>(Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris)</b></i> is a giant <a
                    href="#">cavy</a> rodent
                native to <a href="#">South America</a>.
                It is the largest living <a href="#">Rodent[2]</a> and a member of the genus <a
                    href="#"><i>Hydrochoerus</i></a>. The only other <a href="#">extant</a> member is the
                <a href="#">lesser cabybara</a> (<i>Hydrochoerus isthmius</i>). Its close relatives include <a
                    href="#">guinea pigs</a> and <a href="#">rock cavies</a>, and it is more
                distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas and
                dense
                forests, and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as
                large as
                100 individuals, but usually live in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is hunted for its meat
                and hide
                and also for grease from its thick fatty skin.[3] It is not considered a threatened species.

            <p>Its common name is derived from Tupi ka'apiûara, a complex agglutination of kaá (leaf) + píi (slender) +
                ú (eat)
                + ara (a suffix for agent nouns), meaning "one who eats slender leaves", or "grass-eater".[4]<br><br>
                The
                scientific
                name, both hydrochoerus and hydrochaeris, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor "water") and χοῖρος
                (choiros "pig, hog").[5][6]</p>

            <h2>Classification and phylogeny</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The capybara and the <a href="#">lesser cabybara</a> both belong to the subfamily Hydrochoerinae along
                with the rock cavies. The
                living capybaras and their extinct relatives were previously classified in their own family
                Hydrochoeridae.[7]
                Since 2002, molecular phylogenetic studies have recognized a close relationship between Hydrochoerus and
                Kerodon, the rock cavies,[8] supporting placement of both genera in a subfamily of Caviidae.[5]<br><br>
                Paleontological classifications previously used Hydrochoeridae for all capybaras, while using
                Hydrochoerinae for
                the living genus and its closest fossil relatives, such as Neochoerus,[9][10] but more recently have
                adopted the
                classification of Hydrochoerinae within Caviidae.[11] The taxonomy of fossil hydrochoerines is also in a
                state
                of flux. In recent years, the diversity of fossil hydrochoerines has been substantially reduced.[9][10]
                This is
                largely due to the recognition that capybara molar teeth show strong variation in shape over the life of
                an
                individual.[9] In one instance, material once referred to four genera and seven species on the basis of
                differences in molar shape is now thought to represent differently aged individuals of a single species,
                Cardiatherium paranense.[9] Among fossil species, the name "capybara" can refer to the many species of
                Hydrochoerinae that are more closely related to the modern Hydrochoerus than to the "cardiomyine"
                rodents like
                Cardiomys.[11] The fossil genera Cardiatherium, Phugatherium, Hydrochoeropsis, and Neochoerus are all
                capybaras
                under that concept.[11]</p>

                alt="Capybara image" width="300">
            <p>The capybara has a heavy, barrel-shaped body and short head, with reddish-brown fur on the upper part of
                its body
                that turns yellowish-brown underneath. Its sweat glands can be found in the surface of the hairy
                portions of its
                skin, an unusual trait among rodents.[7] The animal lacks down hair, and its guard hair differs little
                from over
                hair.[12]<br><br>Adult capybaras grow to 106 to 134 cm (3.48 to 4.40 ft) in length, stand 50 to 62 cm
                (20 to 24
                in) tall at the withers, and typically weigh 35 to 66 kg (77 to 146 lb), with an average in the
                Venezuelan
                llanos of 48.9 kg (108 lb).[13][14][15] Females are slightly heavier than males. The top recorded
                weights are 91
                kg (201 lb) for a wild female from Brazil and 73.5 kg (162 lb) for a wild male from Uruguay.[7][16]
                Also, an 81
                kg individual was reported in São Paulo in 2001 or 2002.[17] The dental formula is
                1.0.1.3/1.0.1.3.[7] Capybaras have slightly webbed feet and vestigial tails.[7] Their hind legs are
                slightly
                longer than their
                forelegs; they have three toes on their rear feet and four toes on their front feet.[18] Their muzzles
                are
                blunt, with nostrils, and the eyes and ears are near the top of their heads.<br><br>Its karyotype has 2n
                = 66
                and FN = 102, meaning it has 66 chromosomes with a total of 102 arms.[5][7]</p>

            <h2>Ecology</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Capybaras are semiaquatic mammals[15] found throughout all countries of South America except Chile.[19]
                They
                live in densely forested areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and
                marshes,[14]
                as well as flooded savannah and along rivers in the tropical rainforest. They are superb swimmers and
                can
                hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes at a time. Capybara have flourished in cattle
                ranches.[7] They roam in home ranges averaging 10 hectares (25 acres) in high-density
                populations.[7]<br><br>
                Many escapees from captivity can also be found in similar watery habitats around the world. Sightings
                are
                fairly common in Florida, although a breeding population has not yet been confirmed.[20] In 2011, one
                specimen was spotted on the Central Coast of California.[21] These escaped populations occur in areas
                where
                prehistoric capybaras inhabited; late Pleistocene capybaras inhabited Florida[22] and Hydrochoerus
                hesperotiganites in California and Hydrochoerus gaylordi in Grenada, and feral capybaras in North
                America
                may actually fill the ecological niche of the Pleistocene species.[23]

                alt="Capybara Eating" width="300">
            <p>Capybaras are herbivores, grazing mainly on grasses and aquatic plants,[14][24] as well as fruit and tree
                bark.[15] They are very selective feeders[25] and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other
                species surrounding it. They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are
                available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during
                the
                dry season.[26] Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter,
                so
                they are not consumed at that time.[25] The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food
                by
                grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side.[27] Capybaras are autocoprophagous,[28] meaning they
                eat
                their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms
                their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They also
                regurgitate
                food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle.[28][29] As is the case with other rodents,
                the
                front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses;[19]
                their
                cheek teeth also grow continuously.[27]</p><br><br>Like its relative the guinea pig, the capybara does
            not
            have the capacity to synthesize vitamin C, and capybaras not supplemented with vitamin C in captivity have
            been reported to develop gum disease as a sign of scurvy.[30] <br><br>They can have a lifespan of 8–10
            years,[31] but tend to live less than four years in the wild due to
            predation from jaguars, pumas, ocelots, eagles, and caimans.[19] The capybara is also the preferred prey of
            the green anaconda.[32]</p>
