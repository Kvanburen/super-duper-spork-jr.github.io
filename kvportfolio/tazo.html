            <h1>Tazo Tea Ad</h1>
            <p>This is a series of ads I created for Tazo tea. There are three ads in total, each designed to feel
                cohesive with the rest of the series and use the same assets while keeping their individuality.<br><br>
                The product photos of the tea packets were taken by myself then masked and color corrected to be used
                within the ads. To show off the naturalness of the product I added in a Camellia sinensis which is the
                plant green teas originate from, as well as some dried tea leaves. The last asset I needed was a catchy
                slogan to keep the viewers attention that was quick and memorable so I used the brands slogan “It begins
                with tea.”<br><br>
                Once I had the backbone assets that would be placed in each ad assembled together I dived into adding
                varying colors, shapes, and text formatting to make the ads fun, bright, and eye catching.
