            <h1>Fantasy Conceptual Design</h1>
            <p>For this piece I wanted to create a fantasy design that feels like peeking into a story book. I utilized
                photo bashing techniques to create a series of floating islands within a sea of clouds to add an
                ethereal feel to the work. To keep familiarity to the design I added castles to the islands that we
                would see in our daily lives. The boy in the foreground of the piece is meant to appear as if he is just
                walking into the this world looking out into the unknown. Every fantasy piece needs a mythical creature
                so I decided on dragons to roam the skies and befriend the beings of this world.<br><br>
                This piece is compiled of royalty free images compiled together to create its own unique cohesive piece
                of art. Each image is individually masked and adjusted to ensure balance and unification throughout the
                work.
