            <h1>Atsumeru Logo</h1>
            <p>This is a logo created for a concept ramen restaurant by the name of Atsumeru. The idea was to create a
                logo that doubles as a mascot giving the restaurant a personality of its own and a character for
                consumers to connect with. The logo was designed in a cartoonish manner to give a friendly and inviting
                feel to the viewer that correlates with the atmosphere the restaurant provides. Red was used to give a
                strong emphasis to the design while yellow created balance to make the piece feel warm and less
                intimidating. Using rounded edges and shapes helped to further this feeling.
